        "abstract": "**Background**<br> Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is among the most prevalent liver disorders in Western countries. While steatosis is prevalent, molecular mechanisms associated with steatosis grades and how nutrition modulates related metabolic disturbances remain poorly understood. <br>**Methods**<br> We analyzed data from 327 participants of the CHRIS NAFLD study with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and matched controls, integrating 148 plasma proteins with 175 serum metabolites and lipids to identify circulating biomarkers associated with hepatic steatosis severity. Associations between dietary intake and steatosis were investigated, and a potential influence of diet on the identified biomarkers was evaluated through a sensitivity analysis. Participants were stratified by steatosis grade based on ultrasound-derived measurements. <br>**Results**<br> Steatosis grade was strongly positively correlated with BMI and T2D. Several proteins (e.g., GC, AFM, AZGP1, SERPINC1, VTN, LRG1) and metabolites (e.g., glutamate, tyrosine, valine, lysoPCs) were associated with the highest steatosis grade, mainly reflecting a broader metabolically unhealthy phenotype. Adherence to a plant-based diet was associated with lower steatosis grades independent of circulating proteins, metabolites, and lipids. <br>**Conclusion**<br> Results suggest that circulating metabolic signatures of steatosis reflect broader metabolic dysregulation and are independent of dietary intake. These data support the use of blood-based multi-omics profiling to distinguish between metabolically healthy and unhealthy individuals, and may thus improve MASLD risk stratification.",

We aim to improve the knowledge of the genetics of human olfactory perception by performing an exploratory genome-wide association meta-analysis of up to 21,495 individuals of European ancestry. By sex-stratified and overall analysis of the identification of twelve odours and an identification score, we discovered ten independent loci, seven of them novel, with trait-wise genome-wide significance (*p*\u2009<\u20095 \u00d7 10<sup>-8</sup>) involving five odours. Seven of these loci, including four novel ones, are also significant using a stricter study-wide significance threshold (*p*\u2009<\u20093.85 \u00d7 10<sup>-9</sup>). Loci were predominantly located within clusters of olfactory receptors. Two loci were female-specific while one was sex-differential with respective candidate genes containing androgen response elements. Two-sample Mendelian randomization was applied to search for causal relationships between sex hormones, odour identification and neurodegenerative diseases. A causal negative effect was detected for Alzheimer's disease on the identification score. These findings deepen our understanding of the genetic basis of olfactory perception and its interaction with sex, prioritizing mechanisms for further molecular research.",

        "abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) generated thousands of loci associated with complex traits and diseases. However, to characterize of the pleiotropic, molecular and population genetic bounds of uncovered loci, investigations are conducted, that remain conceptually and practically separated. Also in the best case, such investigations proceed by one locus at a time. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient and reproducible Snakemake pipeline for executing haplotype-based association analysis on GWAS-identified genetic loci, which is especially helpful in samples enriched with molecular omics data. Haplomics takes as input the genetic coordinates of each locus along with all available clinical and molecular phenotypes, the necessary covariates, and VCF genotype files, to reconstruct haplotypes and test them for associations with the phenotypes. The reconstructed haplotypes, the annotation of included variants, and association results are graphically displayed in an HTML report. We tested Haplomics in population-based study sample encompassing 391 traits, including 72 clinical markers, 171 serum metabolites, 148 plasma protein concentrations, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) imputed genotypes. We estimated WES-based haplotypes at 11 kidney function genetic loci from a GWAS and conducted association analyses throughout, identifying 19 significant associations after multiple testing correction. Haplomics is a scalable, easy-to-use and fast haplotype reconstruction and association pipeline that makes it possible to jointly conduct molecular and population-genetic characterization of multiple GWAS loci in unified analysis framework.",

This study investigates life expectancy and disease-specific mortality rates among populations in the Italian Alps and in northern Italian lowland regions. Additionally, cardiometabolic health and serum metabolite concentrations of residents in an Alpine province across three distinct elevation zones (<1,000 m, 1,000-1,500 m, and >1,500 m above sea level) are studied. <br>**Methods**<br> Data on life expectancy and mortality rate (per ten thousand) were retrieved from the ISTAT database for 6 provinces located in the Italian Alps and 6 provinces at sea level near the Alps. Using cross-sectional data from a sub-sample of the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study (n=6,292), we fitted multivariable adjusted logistic regression models to investigate associations between altitude and cardiometabolic health, determined by the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. Moreover, associations between altitude and 175 serum metabolites were evaluated through linear regression models (n=1,447). <br>**Results**<br> Population size and sex distribution were similar between provinces (p>0.485). Life expectancy at 65 years differed between areas (20.8\u00b10.4 vs 20.1\u00b10.3, for Alps vs sea-level, respectively, p=0.026). Mortality rate for diseases of the circulatory system was lower in the Alps than at sea-level (35.3\u00b15.7 vs. 44.5\u00b16.8, respectively, p=0.026). No statistically significant differences were found for mortality (Alps vs. sea-level) from all causes (108.1\u00b115.7 vs. 126.1\u00b115.5, *p*=0.065), cerebrovascular diseases (8.4\u00b12.5 vs. 12.6\u00b13.1, *p*=0.065), endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases (3.6\u00b11.0 vs. 5.0\u00b11.0, *p*=0.065), neoplasms (31.1\u00b14.7 vs. 34.3\u00b12.4 *p*=0.394) and diseases of the respiratory system (8.3\u00b11.7 vs. 8.8\u00b11.7, *p*=0.589). In the CHRIS study sample, living at moderate vs. low altitude level was associated with lower odds of mild to severe conditions in the hypertension (OR:0.77; 95%CI: 0.62-0.96) and endocrine-metabolic domain (OR:0.77, 95%CI: 0.61-0.97). No differences in blood serum metabolic profiles were observed between people living at different altitude levels. <br>**Conclusions**<br> Living in the Italian Alps seems to have a positive effect on life expectancy and mortality from certain diseases compared to living at sea level in northern Italy. Furthermore, living at moderate altitude conferred some cardiometabolic health benefits in the CHRIS study population, even after corrections for confounding factors. The metabolite profile in a sub-sample did, however, not reveal any significant differences between altitude levels.",

We studied the time series of 54 biochemical traits in 4373 individuals from the Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, a pedigree-based study enrolling ten participants/day over several years, with close relatives preferentially invited within the same day. We observed distributional changes of measured traits over time.

We performed variance components (VC) h <sup>2</sup> estimation for all traits after accounting for the enrollment period in a linear mixed model (two-stage approach). Accounting for the enrollment period caused a median h <sup>2</sup> reduction of 4%. For 9 traits, the reduction was of >20%. Results were confirmed by a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis with all VCs included at the same time (one-stage approach). The electrolytes were the traits most affected by the enrollment period. The h <sup>2</sup> inflation was independent of the h <sup>2</sup> magnitude, laboratory protocol changes, and length of the enrollment period.

Using genetic data from up to 5.1 million people (4.6% African ancestry, 14.4% American ancestry, 8.4% East Asian ancestry, 71.1% European ancestry and 1.5% South Asian ancestry) from the GIANT consortium and 23andMe, Inc., we developed ancestry-specific and multi-ancestry PGSs. The multi-ancestry score explained 17.6% of BMI variation among UK Biobank participants of European ancestry. For other populations, this ranged from 16% in East Asian-Americans to 2.2% in rural Ugandans. In the ALSPAC study, children with higher PGSs showed accelerated BMI gain from age 2.5\u2009years to adolescence, with earlier adiposity rebound. Adding the PGS to predictors available at birth nearly doubled explained variance for BMI from age 5 onward (for example, from 11% to 21% at age 8). Up to age 5, adding the PGS to early-life BMI improved prediction of BMI at age 18 (for example, from 22% to 35% at age 5). Higher PGSs were associated with greater adult weight gain. In intensive lifestyle intervention trials, individuals with higher PGSs lost modestly more weight in the first year (0.55\u2009kg per s.d.) but were more likely to regain it. Overall, these data show that PGSs have the potential to improve obesity prediction, particularly when implemented early in life.",

Using self-reported food frequency questionnaire data, we derived the DASH-score and two RRR-based sex-specific DP-scores based on nine cardio-renal-metabolic parameters. We fitted sex-stratified linear and non-linear models to assess associations with creatininebased eGFR.<br>**Results**<br> Males with higher intake of cereals, whole grains, sugar, fruits, and legumes, and lower intake of beer, and red and processed meat (MDP<sub>1</sub>), exhibited higher eGFR levels. Coherently, high adherence to the DASH-style diet was associated with higher eGFR. In females, the associations varied by menstrual status. Among those with ceased menstruation, a low intake of meat, spirits, refined grains, beer, and fish, and a high intake of whole grains and dairy products was associated with higher eGFR. In females still experiencing regular menstruation, a high intake of beef, nuts, beer, legumes, fish, and coffee, and low intake of refined grains, (FDP<sub>2</sub>) was associated with lower eGFR. No association was observed with the DASH score in females.<br>**Conclusion**<br> Our findings confirm the DASH-style diet is associated with better kidney function in males, but not in females. By identifying sex-specific kidney function-oriented DPs, the RRR approach provides new insights into the diet-eGFR relation, highlighting in addition potential effect modification by menstrual status.",

Therefore, here we aimed to elucidate its genetic architecture through a genome-wide association study meta-analysis (GWMA). <br>**Methods**<br> This GWMA included the participants of European ancestry (N\u2009=\u200922,730) enrolled in four different large population-based studies followed by a multi-ancestry GWMA including participants of African ancestry (N\u2009=\u20091,030). Olfactory dysfunction was assessed using a 12-item smell identification test. <br>**Results**<br> GWMA revealed a novel genome-wide significant locus (tagged by single nucleotide polymorphism rs11228623 at the 11q12 locus) associated with olfactory dysfunction. Gene-based analysis revealed a high enrichment for olfactory receptor genes in this region. Phenome-wide association studies demonstrated associations between genetic variants related to olfactory dysfunction and blood cell counts, kidney function, skeletal muscle mass, cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease. Using individual-level data, we also confirmed and quantified the strength of these associations on a phenotypic level. Moreover, employing two-sample Mendelian Randomization analyses, we found evidence for causal associations between olfactory dysfunction and these phenotypes. <br>**Conclusions**<br> Our findings provide novel insights into the genetic architecture of the sense of smell and highlight its importance for many aspects of human health. Moreover, these findings could facilitate the identification and monitoring of individuals at increased risk of olfactory dysfunction and associated diseases.",

        "abstract": "Cardiac desmosomes are specialized cell junctions responsible for cardiomyocytes mechanical coupling. Mutation in desmosomal genes cause autosomal dominant and recessive familial arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Motivated by evidence that Mendelian diseases share genetic architecture with common complex traits, we assessed whether common variants in any desmosomal gene were associated with cardiac conduction traits in the general population. We analysed data of N\u2009=\u20094342 Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study participants. We tested associations between genotype imputed variants covering the five desmosomal genes Desmoplakin (*DSP*), junction plakoglobin *(JUP)*, plakophilin 2 *(PKP2)*, desmoglein 2 *(DSG2)*, and desmocollin 2 *(DSC2)*, and P-wave, PR, QRS, and QT electrocardiographic intervals, using linear mixed models. Functional annotation and interrogation of publicly available genome-wide association study resources implicated potential connection with antisense long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), DNA methylation sites, and complex traits. Causality was tested via two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis and validated with functional in vitro follow-up in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). *DSP* variant rs2744389 was associated with QRS (*P*\u2009=\u20093.5\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-6</sup>), with replication in the Microisolates in South Tyrol (MICROS) study (n\u2009=\u2009636; *P*\u2009=\u20090.010). Observing that rs2744389 was associated with *DSP-AS1* antisense lncRNA but not with *DSP* expression in multiple Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) v8 tissues, we conducted two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses that identified causal effects of *DSP-AS1* on *DSP* expression (*P*\u2009=\u20096.33\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-5</sup>); colocalization posterior probability\u2009=\u20090.91) and QRS (*P*\u2009=\u20090.015). In hiPSC-CMs, *DSP-AS1* expression downregulation through a specific GapmerR matching sequence led to significant *DSP* upregulation at both mRNA and protein levels. The evidence that *DSP-AS1* has a regulatory role on *DSP* opens the venue for further investigations on *DSP-AS1'*s therapeutic potential for conditions caused by reduced desmoplakin production.",

We report a genome-wide association study meta-analysis of thyroid function in up to 271,040 individuals of European ancestry, including reference range thyrotropin (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free and total triiodothyronine (T3), proxies for metabolism (T3/FT4 ratio) as well as dichotomized high and low TSH levels. We revealed 259 independent significant associations for TSH (61% novel), 85 for FT4 (67% novel), and 62 novel signals for the T3 related traits. The loci explained 14.1%, 6.0%, 9.5% and 1.1% of the total variation in TSH, FT4, total\u00a0T3 and free\u00a0T3 concentrations, respectively. Genetic correlations indicate that TSH associated loci reflect the thyroid function determined by free\u00a0T3, whereas the FT4 associations represent the thyroid hormone metabolism. Polygenic risk score and Mendelian randomization analyses showed the effects of genetically determined variation in thyroid function on various clinical outcomes, including cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. In conclusion, our results improve the understanding of thyroid hormone physiology and highlight the pleiotropic effects of thyroid function on various diseases.",

Functional studies implicated *SHROOM3* as the effector gene, demonstrating its developmental role to guarantee podocyte barrier integrity. However, the locus has also been associated with other clinical traits, including electrolytes, hematological, cardiovascular, and neurological traits, not all of which can be easily traced to the regulation of kidney function. We therefore conducted a systematic analysis of the whole locus' genetic profiles (haplotypes) to assess which phenotypic profiles they were associated with. <br>**Methods**<br> For the 4 genes, we reconstructed haplotypes spanning 71 exonic and intronic variants for 12,834 participants in the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study based on genotypes imputed on a local whole-exome sequencing (WES) reference panel. Haplotypes were tested for associations with 72 clinical traits, 170 serum metabolites, and 148 plasma protein concentrations, using linear regression models. <br>**Results**<br> We identified 11 haplotypes with a population frequency between 2% and 24%. Compared with the most common haplotype, most haplotypes were associated with higher creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and lower serum magnesium levels. In addition, specific haplotypes were also associated with biologically diverse groups of traits, including albuminuria, blood pressure, red blood cell traits, carnitines, and amino acids. Cluster analysis highlighted the existence of distinct genetic profiles in which individuals with specific haplotypes presented with specific phenotypic and metabolic signatures. <br>**Conclusion**<br> The genetic variability of the *FAM47E-SHROOM3* locus indicates the existence of population subgroups with distinct biomarker profiles.",

In light of inadequate survey tools, we developed a novel questionnaire for use in population-based studies, to retrospectively assess kidney diseases. <br>**Methods**<br> The questionnaire covered general kidney diseases, reduced kidney function, and renal surgeries. It was administered between 2011 and 2018 to 11,684 participants (median age\u2009=\u200945 years) of the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. Fasting estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured. By factor analysis we contextualized the questionnaire content with respect to the\u00a0biochemical measurements. We estimated overall and sex-stratified prevalence of kidney diseases, including possible CKD, calibrating them to the general target population via relative sampling weights. <br>**Results**<br> Population-representative prevalence of glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis, and congenital kidney diseases was 1.0%, 3.0%, and 0.2%, respectively, with corresponding odds ratios for females versus males of 1.4 (95% confidence interval: 1.0, 2.0), 8.7 (6.2, 12.3), and 0.7 (0.3, 1.6), respectively. Prevalence of kidney dysfunction (eGFR\u2009<\u200960\u00a0mL/min/1.73\u00a0m(2) or UACR\u2009>\u200930\u00a0mg/g) was 8.59%, while prevalence of self-reported CKD was 0.69%, indicating 95.3% of\u00a0lack of disease awareness, with a similar figure in people with diabetes or hypertension. Overall, 15.76% of the population was affected by a kidney disease of any kind. <br>**Conclusion**<br> In the Val Venosta/Vinschgau alpine district, CKD prevalence aligned with Western European estimates. Kidney health questionnaire implementation in population studies is feasible and valuable to assess CKD awareness, which we found to be dramatically low.",

However, the genetic determinants of these traits and the biomedical consequences of iron homoeostasis variation are unclear. In a meta-analysis of 12 cohorts involving 91,675 participants, we found 43 genomic loci associated with either hepcidin or sTfR concentration, of which 15 previously unreported. Mapping to putative genes indicated involvement in iron-trait expression, erythropoiesis, immune response and cellular trafficking. Mendelian randomisation of 292 disease outcomes in 1,492,717 participants revealed associations of iron-related loci and iron status with selected health outcomes across multiple domains. These associations were largely driven by *HFE*, which was associated with the largest iron variation. Our findings enhance understanding of iron homoeostasis and its biomedical consequences, suggesting that lifelong exposure to higher iron levels is likely associated with lower risk of anaemia-related disorders and higher risk of genitourinary, musculoskeletal, infectious and neoplastic diseases.",

Genome-wide association studies have identified 230 independent loci for QT and JT; however, 50% of their heritability remains unexplained. Previous work supports a causal effect of lower serum calcium concentrations on longer ventricular repolarization time. We hypothesized calcium interactions with QT and JT variant associations could explain a proportion of the missing heritability. <br>**Methods and results**<br>We performed genome-wide calcium interaction analyses for QT and JT intervals. Participants were stratified by their calcium level relative to the study distribution (top or bottom 20%). We performed a 2-stage analysis (genome-wide discovery [N=62\u2009532] and replication [N=59\u2009861] of lead variants) and a single-stage genome-wide meta-analysis (N=122\u2009393, [European ancestry N=117\u2009581, African ancestry N=4812]). We also calculated 2-degrees of freedom joint main and interaction and 1-degree of freedom interaction P values. In 2-stage and single-stage analyses, 50 and 98 independent loci, respectively, were associated with either QT or JT intervals (2-degrees of freedom joint main and interaction P value <5\u00d710<sup>-8</sup>). No lead variant had a significant interaction result after correcting for multiple testing and sensitivity analyses provided similar findings. Two loci in the single-stage meta-analysis were not reported previously (*SPPL2B* and *RFX6*). <br>**Conclusions**<br> We have found limited support for an interaction effect of serum calcium on QT and JT variant associations despite sample sizes with suitable power to detect relevant effects. Therefore, such effects are unlikely to explain a meaningful proportion of the heritability of QT and JT, and factors\u00a0including rare variation and other environmental interactions need to be considered.",

Genetic information may be partially disclosed at invitation, thus raising ethical issues which call for defined best practices for disclosure and communication in RbG approaches. Within the context of the ProtectMove sub-project of the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, we investigated research participant perspectives on RbG communication strategies (Step 1 and 4, questionnaire with a subsample of CHRIS participants with and without previous experience of RbG, respectively). Additionally, we explored researchers' and study personnel's experience with RbG (Step 2 and 3, focus group discussion). In step 1 (N\u2009=\u200995), participants were generally satisfied with the study process. Most (71.6%) wanted to know their carrier status for personal and collective benefit. Tailored disclosure strategies and transparent, effective, and well-thought-out communication approaches were advocated by study personnel (Step 2, N\u2009=\u20096) and researchers (Step 3, N\u2009=\u20097). Challenges in dealing with uncertainty, concerns caused by RbG invitations, and the possibility of misunderstanding were also raised. In step 4 (N\u2009=\u2009369), participants valued being informed of study details at the first invitation stage, and generally felt comfortable towards RbG study invitations (58.5%) and to receiving genetic information after the study (58.5-81.6%). Comfort and perceived impact of disclosure of genetic information varied according to the type of variant being potentially disclosed. This study suggested designing communication strategies, based on clear and understandable explanations, sensitive to participant expectations and preferences, developing case-by-case solutions for disclosure.",

        "abstract": "The identification of genetic variants that predispose individuals to cardiovascular disease and a better understanding of their targets would be highly advantageous. Genome-wide association studies have identified variants that associate with QT-interval length (a measure of myocardial repolarization). Three of the strongest associating variants (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) are located in the putative promotor region of *CNOT1*, a gene encoding the central CNOT1 subunit of CCR4-NOT: a multifunctional, conserved complex regulating gene expression and mRNA stability and turnover. We isolated the minimum fragment of the *CNOT1* promoter containing all three variants from individuals homozygous for the QT risk alleles and demonstrated that the haplotype associating with longer QT interval caused reduced reporter expression in a cardiac cell line, suggesting that reduced *CNOT1* expression might contribute to abnormal QT intervals. Systematic siRNA-mediated knockdown of CCR4-NOT components in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) revealed that silencing *CNOT1* and other CCR4-NOT genes reduced their proliferative capacity. Silencing *CNOT7* also shortened action potential duration. Furthermore, the cardiac-specific knockdown of *Drosophila* orthologs of CCR4-NOT genes *in vivo* (*CNOT1*/*Not1* and *CNOT7*/*8*/*Pop2*) was either lethal or resulted in dilated cardiomyopathy, reduced contractility or a propensity for arrhythmia. Silencing *CNOT2*/*Not2*, *CNOT4*/*Not4* and *CNOT6*/*6L*/*twin* also affected cardiac chamber size and contractility. Developmental studies suggested that *CNOT1*/*Not1* and *CNOT7*/*8*/*Pop2* are required during cardiac remodeling from larval to adult stages. To summarize, we have demonstrated how disease-associated genes identified by GWAS can be investigated by combining human cardiomyocyte cell-based and whole-organism *in vivo* heart models. Our results also suggest a potential link of *CNOT1* and *CNOT7*/*8* to QT alterations and further establish a crucial role of the CCR4-NOT complex in heart development and function.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",

Here, we integrate a large GWAS on blood lipids involving 1.6 million individuals from five ancestries with a wide array of functional genomic datasets to discover regulatory mechanisms underlying lipid associations. We first prioritize lipid-associated genes with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) colocalizations and then add chromatin interaction data to narrow the search for functional genes. Polygenic enrichment analysis across 697 annotations from a host of tissues and cell types confirms the central role of the liver in lipid levels and highlights the selective enrichment of adipose-specific chromatin marks in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Overlapping transcription factor (TF) binding sites with lipid-associated loci identifies TFs relevant in lipid biology. In addition, we present an integrative framework to prioritize causal variants at GWAS loci, producing a comprehensive list of candidate causal genes and variants with multiple layers of functional evidence. We highlight two of the prioritized genes, *CREBRF* and *RRBP1*, which show convergent evidence across functional datasets supporting their roles in lipid biology.",

However, the biological pathways underlying these associations are frequently unknown, limiting understanding of these findings and hindering downstream translational efforts such as drug target discovery. <br>**Results**<br> To expand our understanding of the underlying biological pathways and mechanisms controlling blood lipid levels, we leverage a large multi-ancestry meta-analysis (N\u2009=\u20091,654,960) of blood lipids to prioritize putative causal genes for 2286 lipid associations using six gene prediction approaches. Using phenome-wide association (PheWAS) scans, we identify relationships of genetically predicted lipid levels to other diseases and conditions. We confirm known pleiotropic associations with cardiovascular phenotypes and determine novel associations, notably with cholelithiasis risk. We perform sex-stratified GWAS meta-analysis of lipid levels and show that 3-5% of autosomal lipid-associated loci demonstrate sex-biased effects. Finally, we report 21 novel lipid loci identified on the X chromosome. Many of the sex-biased autosomal and X chromosome lipid loci show pleiotropic associations with sex hormones, emphasizing the role of hormone regulation in lipid metabolism. <br>**Conclusions**<br> Taken together, our findings provide insights into the biological mechanisms through which associated variants lead to altered lipid levels and potentially cardiovascular disease risk.",

The governance of genetic resources in the context of genetic biobanks in Italy is discussed, as an example of the stratification of different inputs and rules: EU law, national law, orders made by authorities and soft law, which need to be integrated with ethical principles, technological strategies and solutions. After providing an overview of the Italian legal regulation of genetic data processing, it considers the fate of genetic material and IP rights in the event of a biobank's insolvency. To this end, it analyses two case studies: a controversial bankruptcy case which occurred in Sardinia, one of the first examples of private and public partnership biobanks. Another case study considered is the Chris project: an example of partnership between a research institute in Bolzano and the South Tyrolean Health System. Both cases seem to point in the same direction, suggesting expediency of promoting and improving public-private partnerships to manage biological tissues and biotrust to conciliate patent law and public interest.",

The data collected during the workshop were analysed using a content analysis approach. <br>**Results**<br> Dynamic Consent can provide practical, sustainable and future-proof solutions to challenges related to participant recruitment, the attainment of informed consent, participant retention and consent management, and may bring economic efficiencies. <br>**Conclusions**<br> Dynamic Consent offers opportunities for ongoing communication between researchers and research participants that can positively impact research. Dynamic Consent supports inter-sector, cross-border approaches and large scale data-sharing.

The BioSHaRE-EU Healthy Obese Project aims to gain insights into the consequences of (healthy) obesity using data on risk factors and phenotypes across several large-scale cohort studies. Aim of this study was to describe the prevalence of obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) in ten participating studies. <br>**Methods**<br> Ten different cohorts in seven countries were combined, using data transformed into a harmonized format. All participants were of European origin, with age 18-80\u00a0years. They had participated in a clinical examination for anthropometric and blood pressure measurements. Blood samples had been drawn for analysis of lipids and glucose. Presence of MetS was assessed in those with obesity (BMI\u2009\u2265\u200930\u00a0kg/m2) based on the 2001 NCEP ATP III criteria, as well as an adapted set of less strict criteria. MHO was defined as obesity, having none of the MetS components, and no previous diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. <br>**Results**<br> Data for 163,517 individuals were available; 17% were obese (11,465 men and 16,612 women). The prevalence of obesity varied from 11.6% in the Italian CHRIS cohort to 26.3% in the German KORA cohort. The age-standardized percentage of obese subjects with MetS ranged in women from 24% in CHRIS to 65% in the Finnish Health2000 cohort, and in men from 43% in CHRIS to 78% in the Finnish DILGOM cohort, with elevated blood pressure the most frequently occurring factor contributing to the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome. The age-standardized prevalence of MHO varied in women from 7% in Health2000 to 28% in NCDS, and in men from 2% in DILGOM to 19% in CHRIS. MHO was more prevalent in women than in men, and decreased with age in both sexes. <br>**Conclusions**<br> Through a rigorous harmonization process, the BioSHaRE-EU consortium was able to compare key characteristics defining the metabolically healthy obese phenotype across ten cohort studies. There is considerable variability in the prevalence of healthy obesity across the different European populations studied, even when unified criteria were used to classify this phenotype.",

Studies and institutions deciding to return genetic results will need to design their own study-specific return policy after due consideration of the ethical responsibilities. The Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, a healthy cohort study, did not foresee the return of individual genomic results during its baseline phase. However, as it was expected that the follow-up phase would generate an increasing amount of reliable genetic results, an update of the return of research results (RoRR) policy became necessary. To inform this revision, an empirical study using mixed methods was developed to investigate the views of CHRIS research participants (20), local general practitioners (3) and the local genetic counselling service (1). During the interviews, three different examples of potential genetic results with a very diverse potential impact on participants were presented: breast cancer, Parkinson disease and Huntington disease. The CHRIS participants also completed a short questionnaire, collecting personal information and asking for a self-evaluation of their knowledge about genetics. This study made it clear that research participants want to make autonomous decisions on the disclosure or non-disclosure of their results. While the motivations for participants' decisions were very diverse, we were able to identify several common criteria that had a strong influence on their choices. Providing information on these factors is crucial to enable participants to make truly informed decisions.",

RbG approaches pose major ethical and legal challenges related to the disclosure of possibly unwanted genetic information. The Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study is a longitudinal cohort study based in South Tyrol, Italy. Demand has grown for CHRIS study participants to be enrolled in RbG studies, thus making the design of a suitable ethical framework a pressing need. We here report upon the design of a pilot RbG study conducted with CHRIS study participants. By reviewing the literature and by consulting relevant stakeholders (CHRIS participants, clinical geneticists, ethics board, GPs), we identified key ethical issues in RbG approaches (e.g. complexity of the context, communication of genetic results, measures to further protect participants). The design of the pilot was based on a feasibility assessment, the selection of a suitable test case within the ProtectMove Research Unit on reduced penetrance of hereditary movement disorders, and the development of appropriate recruitment and communication strategies. An empirical study was embedded in the pilot study with the aim of understanding participants' views on RbG. Our experience with the pilot study in CHRIS allowed us to contribute to the development of best practices and policies for RbG studies by drawing recommendations: addressing the possibility of RbG in the original consent, implementing tailored communication strategies, engaging stakeholders, designing embedded empirical studies, and sharing research experiences and methodology.",

Although environmental, clinical and social factors have a role in the chance of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and the severity of COVID-19, host genetics may also be important. Identifying host-specific genetic factors may reveal biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal relationships of modifiable environmental risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and outcomes. We formed a global network of researchers to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. Here we describe the results of three genome-wide association meta-analyses that consist of up to 49,562 patients with COVID-19 from 46 studies across 19 countries. We report 13 genome-wide significant loci that are associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID-19. Several of these loci correspond to previously documented associations to lung or autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection. Mendelian randomization analyses support a causal role for smoking and body-mass index for severe COVID-19 although not for type II diabetes. The identification of novel host genetic factors associated with COVID-19 was made possible by the community of human genetics researchers coming together to prioritize the sharing of data, results, resources and analytical frameworks. This working model of international collaboration underscores what is possible for future genetic discoveries in emerging pandemics, or indeed for any complex human disease.",

        "abstract": "The QT interval is an electrocardiographic measure representing the sum of ventricular depolarization and repolarization, estimated by QRS duration and JT interval, respectively. QT interval abnormalities are associated with potentially fatal ventricular arrhythmia. Using genome-wide multi-ancestry analyses (>250,000 individuals) we identify 177, 156 and 121 independent loci for QT, JT and QRS, respectively, including a male-specific X-chromosome locus. Using gene-based rare-variant methods, we identify associations with Mendelian disease genes. Enrichments are observed in established pathways for QT and JT, and previously unreported genes indicated in insulin-receptor signalling and cardiac energy metabolism. In contrast for QRS, connective tissue components and processes for cell growth and extracellular matrix interactions are significantly enriched. We demonstrate polygenic risk score associations with atrial fibrillation, conduction disease and sudden cardiac death. Prioritization of druggable genes highlight potential therapeutic targets for arrhythmia. Together, these results substantially advance our understanding of the genetic architecture of ventricular depolarization and repolarization.",

Given the established role of PINK1/Parkin in regulating mitochondrial dynamics, we explored mitochondrial DNA integrity and inflammation as disease modifiers in carriers of mutations in these genes. Mitochondrial DNA integrity was investigated in a large collection of biallelic (n = 84) and monoallelic (n = 170) carriers of *PINK1/PRKN* mutations, idiopathic Parkinson's disease patients (n = 67) and controls (n = 90). In addition, we studied global gene expression and serum cytokine levels in a subset. Affected and unaffected *PINK1/PRKN* monoallelic mutation carriers can be distinguished by heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA variant load (area under the curve = 0.83, CI 0.74-0.93). Biallelic *PINK1/PRKN* mutation carriers harbour more heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA variants in blood (P = 0.0006, Z = 3.63) compared to monoallelic mutation carriers. This enrichment was confirmed in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived (controls, n = 3; biallelic PRKN mutation carriers, n = 4) and post-mortem (control, n = 1; biallelic PRKN mutation carrier, n = 1) midbrain neurons. Last, the heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA variant load correlated with IL6 levels in *PINK1/PRKN* mutation carriers (r = 0.57, *P* = 0.0074). *PINK1/PRKN* mutations predispose individuals to mitochondrial DNA variant accumulation in a dose- and disease-dependent manner.",

Salivary microbiota taxa were assigned from amplicon sequences of the 16S-V4 rRNA and used to describe microbiota composition and predict metabolic pathways. Aerobic taxa relative abundance decreased with daily smoking intensity and increased with years since cessation, as did inferred nitrate reduction. Former smokers tended to be more similar to Never smokers than to Current smokers, especially those who had quit for longer than 5\u00a0years. Cigarette smoking has a consistent, generalizable association on oral microbiota composition and predicted metabolic pathways, some of which associate in a dose-dependent fashion.

However, both the genotyping chips and imputation reference panels are dependent on next-generation sequencing (NGS). Due to the nature of NGS, some regions of the genome are inaccessible to sequencing. To date, there has been no complete evaluation of these regions and their impact on the identification of associations in GWAS remains unclear. In this study, we systematically assess the extent to which variants in inaccessible regions are underrepresented on genotyping chips and imputation reference panels, in GWAS results and in variant databases. We also determine the proportion of genes located in inaccessible regions and compare the results across variant masks defined by the 1000 Genomes Project and the TOPMed program. Overall, fewer variants were observed in inaccessible regions in all categories analyzed. Depending on the mask used and normalized for region size, only 4%-17% of the genotyped variants are located in inaccessible regions and 52 to 581 genes were almost completely inaccessible. From the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, we present a case study of an association located in an inaccessible region that is driven by genotyped variants and cannot be reproduced by imputation in GRCh37. We conclude that genotyping, NGS, genotype imputation and downstream analyses such as GWAS and fine mapping are systematically biased in inaccessible regions, due to missed variants and spurious associations. To help researchers assess gene and variant accessibility, we provide an online application ([https://gab.gm.eurac.edu](https://gab.gm.eurac.edu)).",

Different factors are associated with reduced olfactory function, including age, sex, as well as health and lifestyle conditions. However, most studies that aimed at identifying the variables that drive olfactory function in the population suffered from methodological weaknesses in study designs and participant selection, such as the inclusion of convenience sample or only of certain age groups, or recruitment biases. We aimed to overcome these issues by investigating the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) cohort, a population-based cohort, by using a validated odor identification test. Specifically, we hypothesized that a series of medical, demographic and lifestyle variables is associated with odor identification abilities. In addition, our goal was to provide clinicians and researchers with normative values for the Sniffin' Sticks identification set, after exclusion of individuals with impaired nasal patency. We included 6,944 participants without acute nasal obstruction and assessed several biological, social, and medical parameters. A basic model determined that age, sex, years of education, and smoking status together explained roughly 13% of the total variance in the data. We further observed that variables related to medical (positive screening for cognitive impairment and for Parkinson's disease, history of skull fracture, stage 2 hypertension) and lifestyle (alcohol abstinence) conditions had a negative effect on odor identification scores. Finally, we provide clinicians with normative values for both versions of the Sniffin' Sticks odor identification test, i.e. with 16 items and with 12 items.",

Using a priori knowledge, we derived disease-related dietary patterns (DPs) through reduced rank regression (RRR) and investigated associations with kidney function, separately focusing on generally healthy individuals and those with self-reported kidney diseases, hypertension, or diabetes mellitus. <br>**Methods**<br> Eight thousand six hundred eighty-six participants from the population-based Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol study were split into a group free of kidney disease, hypertension and diabetes (n\u00a0=\u00a06,133) and a group with any of the 3 conditions (n\u00a0=\u00a02,553). Diet was assessed through the self-administered Global Allergy and Asthma Network of Excellence food frequency questionnaire and DPs were derived through RRR selecting food frequency questionnaire-derived sodium, potassium, phosphorus, and protein intake as mediators. Outcomes were creatinine-based estimated glomerular filtration rate, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, CKD and microalbuminuria. Multiple linear and logistic models were used to assess associations between RRR-based DPs and kidney outcomes separately in the 2 analytic groups. <br>**Results**<br> We identified 3 DPs, where high adherence reflected high levels of all nutrients (DP1), high potassium-phosphorus and low protein-sodium levels (DP2), and low potassium-sodium and high protein-phosphorus levels (DP3), respectively. We observed heterogeneous associations with kidney outcomes, varying by analytic group and sex. Kidney outcomes were much more strongly associated with DPs than with single nutrients. <br>**Conclusion**<br> RRR is a feasible approach to estimate disease-related DPs and explore the combined effects of nutrients on kidney health. Heterogeneous associations across kidney outcomes suggest possible specificity to kidney function or damage. In individuals reporting kidney disease, hypertension or diabetes, specific dietary habits were associated with better kidney health, indicating that disease-specific dietary interventions can be effective for disease control.",

        "abstract": "**Background**<br> The study of circulating blood proteins in population cohorts offers new avenues to explore lifestyle-related and genetic influences describing and shaping human health. <br>**Methods**<br> Utilizing high-throughput mass spectrometry, we quantified 148 highly abundant proteins, functioning in the innate and adaptive immune system, coagulation and nutrient transport in 3632 blood plasma, and 500 serum samples from the CHRIS and BASE-II cross-sectional population studies, respectively. Through multiple regression analyses, we aimed to identify the main factors influencing the circulating proteome at population level. <br>**Results**<br> Many demographic covariates and common medications affect the concentration of high-abundant plasma proteins, but the most significant changes are linked to the use of hormonal contraceptives (HCU). HCU particularly alters amongst others the levels of Angiotensinogen and Transcortin. We robustly replicated these findings in the BASE-II cohort. Furthermore, our results indicate that combined hormonal contraceptives with ethinylestradiol have a stronger effect compared to bioidentical estrogens. Our analysis detects no lasting impact of hormonal contraceptives on the plasma proteome. <br>**Conclusions**<br> HCU is the dominant factor reshaping the high-abundant circulating blood proteome in two population studies. Given the high prevalence of HCU among young women, it is essential to account for this treatment in human proteome studies to avoid misinterpreting its impact as sex- or age-related effects. Although we did not investigate the influence of HCU-induced proteomic changes on human health, our data suggest that future studies on this topic are warranted.",

        "abstract": "**Background**<br> Tremor is commonly found among healthy humans or prevalently a symptom of neurological dysfunctions. However, the distinction between physiological and pathological tremor is dependent on the examiner's competence. Archimedes Spiral Rating (ASR) is a valid and reproducible semi-quantitative method to assess the severity of action tremor. <br>**Objectives**<br> (1) To assess the range and percentiles of ASR in a large sample seemingly free of tremor-related conditions or symptoms from the population-based CHRIS-study. (2) To analyze the influence of sex, age, and the drawing hand on ASR. (3) To define ASR limits of normal. (4) To supply exemplary Archimedes spiral drawings by each rating to favor consistent and proficient clinical evaluation. <br>**Methods**<br> Accurately investigated participants were randomly sampled over 14 sex-age strata. 2686 paired spirals drawn with both hands by 1343 participants were expertly assessed on a tremor rating scale from 0 to 9. <br>**Results**<br> ASR had a quadratic increase with age in both sexes, while it was relatively lower in the dominant compared to the non-dominant hand and in women compared to men. ASRs above sex-age specific 97.5th percentiles of 4 and 5, below and above 60\u2009years of age, respectively, were conceivably of non-physiological nature. <br>**Conclusions**<br> In a large population-based sample we show a steeper increase of action tremor by age as age progresses. Relatively higher ratings among the elderly, males and the non-dominant hands, appear compatible with ASR limits of \"normal\" across sex-age groups. The current operational evidence may support practitioners differentiating physiological and pathological hand tremor.",

        "abstract": "Genetic studies have identified numerous regions associated with plasma fibrinogen levels in Europeans, yet missing heritability and limited inclusion of non-Europeans necessitates further studies with improved power and sensitivity. Compared with array-based genotyping, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data provide better coverage of the genome and better representation of non-European variants. To better understand the genetic landscape regulating plasma fibrinogen levels, we meta-analyzed WGS data from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine (TOPMed) program (n\u00a0=\u00a032\u2009572), with array-based genotype data from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium (n\u00a0=\u00a0131\u2009340) imputed to the TOPMed or Haplotype Reference Consortium panel. We identified 18 loci that have not been identified in prior genetic studies of fibrinogen. Of these, 4 are driven by common variants of small effect with reported minor allele frequency (MAF) at least 10 percentage points higher in African populations. Three signals (*SERPINA1*, *ZFP36L2*, and *TLR10*) contain predicted deleterious missense variants. Two loci, *SOCS3* and *HPN*, each harbor 2 conditionally distinct, noncoding variants. The gene region encoding the fibrinogen protein chain subunits (*FGG*;*FGB*;*FGA*) contains 7 distinct signals, including 1 novel signal driven by rs28577061, a variant common in African ancestry populations but extremely rare in Europeans (MAF<sub>AFR</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.180; MAF<sub>EUR</sub>\u00a0=\u00a00.008). Through phenome-wide association studies in the VA Million Veteran Program, we found associations between fibrinogen polygenic risk scores and thrombotic and inflammatory disease phenotypes, including an association with gout. Our findings demonstrate the utility of WGS to augment genetic discovery in diverse populations and offer new insights for putative mechanisms of fibrinogen regulation.",

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been performed to unravel underlying mechanisms of mtDNA-CN regulation. However, the identified gene regions explain only a small fraction of mtDNA-CN variability. Most of this data has been estimated from microarrays based on various pipelines. In the present study we aimed to (1) identify genetic loci for qPCR-measured mtDNA-CN from three studies (16,130 participants) using GWAS, (2) identify potential systematic differences between our qPCR derived mtDNA-CN measurements compared to the published microarray intensity-based estimates, and (3) disentangle the nuclear from mitochondrial regulation of the mtDNA-CN phenotype. We identified two genome-wide significant autosomal loci associated with qPCR-measured mtDNA-CN: at *HBS1L* (rs4895440, p\u2009=\u20093.39\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-13</sup>) and *GSDMA* (rs56030650, p\u2009=\u20094.85\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>-08</sup>) genes. Moreover, 113/115 of the previously published SNPs identified by microarray-based analyses were significantly equivalent with our findings. In our study, the mitochondrial genome itself contributed only marginally to mtDNA-CN regulation as we only detected a single rare mitochondrial variant associated with mtDNA-CN. Furthermore, we incorporated mitochondrial haplogroups into our analyses to explore their potential impact on mtDNA-CN. However, our findings indicate that they do not exert any significant influence on our results.",

We had 174 metabolites and 148 proteins quantified from fasting serum and plasma samples. We used the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) Comorbidity Index (CMI), which considers morbidity in 14 organ systems, to assess health status (any morbidity vs. healthy). Omics-signatures for health status were identified using random forest (RF) classifiers. Linear regression models were fitted to assess directionality of omics markers and health status associations, as well as to identify omics markers related to organ-specific morbidity. Next to age, we identified 21 metabolites and 10 proteins as relevant predictors of health status and results confirmed associations for serotonin and glutamate to be age-independent. Considering organ-specific morbidity, several metabolites and proteins were jointly related to endocrine, cardiovascular, and renal morbidity. To conclude, circulating serotonin was identified as a potential novel predictor for overall morbidity.",

To identify molecular targets for treatment and prevention, genome-wide association study meta-analyses (GWAMAs) of CKD-defining traits have identified hundreds of genetic loci in aggregated population samples. However, while GWAMAs estimate the average allelic effect across studies, single population studies may be relevant to unravel specific mechanisms. To assess whether a study sample from a specific population could extend existing knowledge on kidney function genetics, we selected 147 kidney function relevant loci identified by a large GWAMA, assessing their association with the glomerular filtration rate estimated from serum creatinine (eGFRcrea) in 10,146 participants to the Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, conducted in an Alpine region where thyroid dysfunction is common. We identified associations with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at 11 loci, showing up-to-5.4 times larger effect sizes than in the corresponding GWAMA, not explainable by allele frequency differences. Systematic mediation analysis across 70 quantitative traits identified serum magnesium and the activated partial thromboplastin time as partial mediators of the eGFRcrea associations at *SHROOM3* and *SLC34A1*, respectively. Given that free triiodothyronine and thyroxine acted as effect modifiers across all loci, we conducted SNP-by-thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) interaction analyses, identifying significant interactions at *STC1:* SNPs had larger effects on eGFRcrea at higher TSH levels, possibly reflecting stanniocalcin-1 autocrine and paracrine role. Individual population studies can help characterize genetic associations. The interplay between phenotypes at *SHROOM3* and *SLC34A1* and the role of thyroid function as a genetic effect modifier warrant further investigations.",

Longitudinal population representative studies on incident events and symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are scarce. We aimed at describing the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020 and 2021 through regular monitoring of self-reported symptoms in an Alpine community sample. <br>**Design**<br> To this purpose, we designed a longitudinal population representative study, the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol COVID-19 study. <br>**Participants and outcome measures**<br> A sample of 845 participants was retrospectively investigated for active and past infections with swab and blood tests, by August 2020, allowing adjusted cumulative incidence estimation. Of them, 700 participants without previous infection or vaccination were followed up monthly until July 2021 for first-time infection and symptom self-reporting: COVID-19 anamnesis, social contacts, lifestyle and sociodemographic data were assessed remotely through digital questionnaires. Temporal symptom trajectories and infection rates were modelled through longitudinal clustering and dynamic correlation analysis. Negative binomial regression and random forest analysis assessed the relative importance of symptoms. <br>**Results**<br> At baseline, the cumulative incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was 1.10% (95% CI 0.51%, 2.10%). Symptom trajectories mimicked both self-reported and confirmed cases of incident infections. Cluster analysis identified two groups of high-frequency and low-frequency symptoms. Symptoms like fever and loss of smell fell in the low-frequency cluster. Symptoms most discriminative of test positivity (loss of smell, fatigue and joint-muscle aches) confirmed prior evidence. <br>**Conclusions**<br> Regular symptom tracking from population representative samples is an effective screening tool auxiliary to laboratory diagnostics for novel pathogens at critical times, as manifested in this study of COVID-19 patterns. Integrated surveillance systems might benefit from more direct involvement of citizens' active symptom tracking.",

We identify seven loci, encompassing 13 independent, pathway-specific variants located in or near complement genes (*CFHR4*, *C7*, *C2*, *MBL2*) and non-complement genes (*PDE3A*, *TNXB*, *ABO*), explaining up to 74% of complement pathways' genetic heritability and implicating long-range haplotypes associated with LP at *MBL2*. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses, supported by transcriptome- and proteome-wide colocalization, confirm known causal pathways, establish within-complement feedback loops, and implicate causality of ABO on LP and of CFHR2 and C7 on AP.

It is unclear which estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) equation best predict an increased CVD risk and if prediction can be improved by integration of multiple kidney function markers. We performed structural equation modeling (SEM) of kidney markers and compared the performance of the resulting pooled indexes with established eGFR equations to predict CVD risk in a 10-year longitudinal population-based design. We split the study sample into a set of participants with only baseline data (n = 647; model-building set) and a set with longitudinal data (n = 670; longitudinal set). In the model-building set, we fitted five SEM models based on serum creatinine or creatinine-based eGFR (eGFRcre), cystatin C or cystatin-based eGFR (eGFRcys), uric acid (UA), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). In the longitudinal set, 10-year incident CVD risk was defined as a Framingham risk score (FRS)>5% and a pooled cohort equation (PCE)>5%. Predictive performances of the different kidney function indexes were compared using the C-statistic and the DeLong test. In the longitudinal set, a SEM-based estimate of latent kidney function based on eGFRcre, eGFRcys, UA, and BUN showed better prediction performance for both FRS>5% (C-statistic: 0.70; 95% CI: 0.65-0.74) and PCE>5% (C-statistic: 0.75; 95%CI: 0.71-0.79) than other SEM models and different eGFR formulas (DeLong test *p*-values<3.21\u00d710<sup>-6</sup> for FRS>5% and <1.49\u00d710<sup>-9</sup> for PCE>5%, respectively). However, the new derived marker could not outperform eGFRcys (DeLong test *p*-values = 0.88 for FRS>5% and 0.20 for PCE>5%, respectively). SEM is a promising approach to identify latent kidney function signatures. However, for incident CVD risk prediction, eGFRcys could still be preferrable given its simpler derivation.",

Previous genetic association studies involving antithrombin, PC, and PS were limited by modest sample sizes or by being restricted to candidate genes. In the setting of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium, we meta-analyzed across ancestries the results from 10 genome-wide association studies of plasma levels of antithrombin, PC, PS free, and PS total. <br>**Methods**<br> Study participants were of European and African ancestries, and genotype data were imputed to TOPMed, a dense multiancestry reference panel.

Analysis of antithrombin included 25\u2009243 European ancestry and 2688 African ancestry participants, PC analysis included 16\u2009597 European ancestry and 2688 African ancestry participants, PSF and PST analysis included 4113 and 6409 European ancestry participants. We also conducted transcriptome-wide association analyses and multiphenotype analysis to discover additional associations.

Transcriptome-wide association analyses identified 3 newly associated genes: 1 with antithrombin level (*FCGRT*), 1 with PC (*GOLM2*), and 1 with PS (*MYL7*). In addition, we replicated 7 independent loci reported in previous studies. Functional experiments provided evidence for the involvement of *GCKR*, *SNX17*, and *HP* genes in antithrombin regulation. <br>**Conclusions**<br> The use of larger sample sizes, diverse populations, and a denser imputation reference panel allowed the detection of 7 novel genomic loci associated with plasma antithrombin, PC, and PS levels.",

RbG enables the further study of a particular variant of interest, but in recalling participants, it risks disclosing potentially unwanted or distressing genetic information. Any RbG strategy must therefore be done in a manner that addresses the potential ethical and social issues. As part of an RbG pilot on the penetrance of Parkinson's disease variants, we conducted an empirical mixed-method study with 51 participants of the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study to understand participant views on RbG research approach. Participants were disclosed the disease under investigation but not the individual variant carrier status. Results showed that participants filtered the information received through personal experience and enacted mechanisms to address the concerns raised by invitation by resorting to personal resources and the support provided by experts. While the non-disclosure of the Parkin variant carrier status was deemed acceptable, disclosing the disease under study was important for participants. Participant preferences for disclosure of the disease under investigation and the carrier status varied according to how the knowledge of individual carrier status was perceived to impact the participant's life. This study provided insights into participant response to the RbG research approach, which are relevant for RbG policy development. A suitable communication strategy and granular options addressing preferences for invitation in the original informed consent are critical for an ethically informed RbG policy.",

The present work is motivated by a study, where the objective was to explore the potential of the molecular biomarkers of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) to identify the undertaken antihypertensive treatments in the general population. Population-based studies offer an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of treatments in real-world scenarios. However, lack of quality documentation, especially when electronic health record linkage is unavailable, leads to inaccurate reporting and classification bias. <br>**Method**<br> We present a machine learning clustering technique to determine the potential of measured RAAS biomarkers for the identification of undertaken treatments in the general population. The biomarkers were simultaneously determined through a novel mass-spectrometry analysis in 800 participants of the Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol (CHRIS) study with documented antihypertensive treatments. We assessed the agreement, sensitivity and specificity of the resulting clusters against known treatment types. Through the lasso penalized regression, we identified clinical characteristics associated with the biomarkers, accounting for the effects of cluster and treatment classifications. <br>**Results**<br> We identified three well-separated clusters: cluster 1 (n\u2009=\u2009444) preferentially including individuals not receiving RAAS-targeting drugs; cluster 2 (n\u2009=\u2009235) identifying angiotensin type 1 receptor blockers (ARB) users (weighted kappa \u03ba<sub>w</sub>)\u2009=\u200974%; sensitivity\u2009=\u200973%; specificity\u2009=\u200983%); and cluster 3 (n\u2009=\u2009121) well discriminating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) users (\u03ba<sub>w</sub>\u2009=\u200981%; sensitivity\u2009=\u200955%; specificity\u2009=\u200990%). Individuals in clusters 2 and 3 had higher frequency of diabetes as well as higher fasting glucose and BMI levels. Age, sex and kidney function were strong predictors of the RAAS biomarkers independently of the cluster structure. <br>**Conclusions**<br> Unsupervised clustering of angiotensin-based biomarkers is a viable technique to identify individuals on specific antihypertensive treatments, pointing to a potential application of the biomarkers as useful clinical diagnostic tools even outside of a controlled clinical setting.",

To increase power, we imputed the identified variants into an additional 2211 genotyped individuals of CHRIS.

In the presence of pathogenic heterozygous variants, it is therefore important to test for mitochondrial alteration in cells derived from variant carriers to establish potential presymptomatic molecular markers. We generated lymphoblasts (LCLs) and human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived neurons from non-manifesting heterozygous *PRKN* variant carriers and tested them for mitochondrial functionality. In LCLs, we detected hyperactive mitochondrial respiration, and, although milder compared to a biallelic *PRKN*-PD patient, hiPSC-derived neurons of non-manifesting heterozygous variant carriers also displayed several phenotypes of altered mitochondrial function. Overall, we identified molecular phenotypes that might be used to monitor heterozygous *PRKN* variant carriers during the prodromal phase. Such markers might also be useful to identify individuals at greater risk of eventual disease development and for testing potential mitochondrial function-based neuroprotective therapies before neurodegeneration advances.",

A random sample of 1450 participants representative of the district population was invited to assess active (nasopharyngeal swab) or past (serum antibody test) infections. We prospectively invited for complete SARS-CoV-2 testing all questionnaire completers gauged as possible cases of past infection and their household members. In positive tested individuals, antibody response is monitored quarterly for one year. Untested and negative participants receive the screening questionnaire every four weeks until gauged as possible incident cases or till the study end.Originated from a collaboration between researchers and community stakeholders, the CHRIS COVID-19 study aims at generating knowledge about the epidemiological, molecular, and genetic characterization of COVID-19 and its long-term sequelae.",

Less is known about what may drive the probability to undergo testing. Understanding how much testing is driven by contextual or individual conditions is important to delineate the role of individual behavior and to shape public health interventions and resource allocation. In the Val Venosta/Vinschgau district (South Tyrol, Italy), we conducted a population-representative longitudinal study on 697 individuals susceptible to first infection who completed 4,512 repeated online questionnaires at four-week intervals between September 2020 and May 2021. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were fitted to investigate associations of self-reported SARS-CoV-2 testing with individual characteristics (social, demographic, and biological) and contextual determinants. Testing was associated with month of reporting, reflecting the timing of both the pandemic intensity and public health interventions, COVID-19-related symptoms (odds ratio, OR:8.26; 95% confidence interval, CI:6.04-11.31), contacts with infected individuals within home (OR:7.47, 95%CI:3.81-14.62) or outside home (OR:9.87, 95%CI:5.78-16.85), and being retired (OR:0.50, 95%CI:0.34-0.73). Symptoms and next within- and outside-home contacts were the leading determinants of swab testing predisposition in the most acute phase of the pandemics. Testing was not associated with age, sex, education, comorbidities, or lifestyle factors. In the study area, contextual determinants reflecting the course of the pandemic were predominant compared to individual sociodemographic characteristics in explaining the SARS-CoV-2 probability of testing. Decision makers should evaluate whether the intended target groups were correctly prioritized by the testing campaign.",

Here, using data from a genome-wide association study of 5.4\u2009million individuals of diverse ancestries, we show\u00a0that 12,111 independent SNPs that are significantly associated with height account for nearly all of the common SNP-based heritability. These SNPs are clustered within 7,209 non-overlapping genomic segments with a mean size of around 90\u2009kb, covering about 21% of the genome. The density of independent associations varies across the genome and the regions of increased density are enriched for biologically relevant genes. In out-of-sample estimation and prediction, the 12,111 SNPs (or all SNPs in the HapMap 3 panel) account for 40% (45%) of phenotypic variance in populations of European ancestry but only around 10-20% (14-24%) in populations of other ancestries. Effect sizes, associated regions and gene prioritization are similar across ancestries, indicating that reduced prediction accuracy is likely to be explained by linkage disequilibrium and differences in allele frequency within associated regions. Finally, we show that the relevant biological pathways are detectable with smaller sample sizes than are needed to implicate causal genes and variants. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive map of specific genomic regions that contain the vast majority of common height-associated variants. Although this map is saturated for populations of European ancestry, further research is needed to achieve equivalent saturation in other ancestries.",

Metabolite concentrations are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Concentrations of certain metabolites can further depend on age, sex, menopause, and diet of study participants. A better understanding of these relationships is pivotal for the planning of metabolomics studies involving human subjects and interpretation of their results. We generated one of the largest single-site targeted metabolomics data sets consisting of 175 quantified metabolites in 6872 study participants. We identified metabolites significantly associated with age, sex, body mass index, diet, and menopausal status. While most of our results agree with previous large-scale studies, we also found novel associations including serotonin as a sex and BMI-related metabolite and sarcosine and C2 carnitine showing significantly higher concentrations in post-menopausal women. Finally, we observed strong associations between higher consumption of food items and certain metabolites, mostly phosphatidylcholines and lysophosphatidylcholines. Most, and the strongest, relationships were found for habitual meat intake while no significant relationships were found for most fruits, vegetables, and grain products. Summarizing, our results reconfirm findings from previous population-based studies on an independent cohort. Together, these findings will ultimately enable the consolidation of sets of metabolites which are related to age, sex, BMI, and menopause as well as to participants' diet.",

We conducted genome-wide association meta-analyses for estimated GFR based on serum creatinine (eGFR), separately for individuals with or without DM (n<sub>DM</sub>\u2009=\u2009178,691, n<sub>noDM</sub>\u2009=\u20091,296,113). Our genome-wide searches identified (i) seven eGFR loci with significant DM/noDM-difference, (ii) four additional novel loci with suggestive difference and (iii) 28 further novel loci (including *CUBN*) by allowing for potential difference. GWAS on eGFR among DM individuals identified 2 known and 27 potentially responsible loci for diabetic kidney disease. Gene prioritization highlighted 18 genes that may inform reno-protective drug development. We highlight the existence of DM-only and noDM-only effects, which can inform about the target group, if respective genes are advanced as drug targets. Largely shared effects suggest that most drug interventions to alter eGFR should be effective in DM and noDM.",

To expand the limited understanding of AF biological mechanisms, we performed two screenings, investigating the genetic and metabolic determinants of AF in the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol study. We found 110 AF cases out of 10,509 general population individuals. A genome-wide association scan (GWAS) identified two novel loci (*p*-value < 5 \u00d7 10<sup>-8</sup>) around SNPs rs745582874, next to gene *PBX1*, and rs768476991, within gene *PCCA*, with genotype calling confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Risk alleles at both SNPs were enriched in a family detected through familial aggregation analysis of the phenotype, and both rare alleles co-segregated with AF. The metabolic screening of 175 metabolites, in a subset of individuals, revealed a 41% lower concentration of lysophosphatidylcholine lysoPC a C20:3 in AF cases compared to controls (*p*-adj = 0.005). The genetic findings, combined with previous evidence, indicate that the two identified GWAS loci may be considered novel genetic rare determinants for AF. Considering additionally the association of lysoPC a C20:3 with AF by metabolic screening, our results demonstrate the valuable contribution of the combined genomic and metabolomic approach in studying AF in large-scale population studies.",

Heterozygous *PRKN* mutation carriers might also be at increased risk for developing clinical symptoms of PD. Given the high frequency of heterozygous mutations in the general population, it is essential to have better estimates of the penetrance of these variants, and to investigate, which clinical and biochemical markers are present in carriers and thus potentially useful for identifying those individuals at greater risk of developing clinical symptoms later in life. In the present study, we ascertained the frequency of heterozygous *PRKN* mutation carriers in a large population sample of the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, and screened for reported PD risk markers. 164 confirmed heterozygous *PRKN* mutation carriers were compared with 2,582 controls. A higher number of heterozygous mutation carriers reported a detectable increase in an akinesia-related phenotype, and a higher percentage of carriers had manifested diabetes. We also observed lower resting heart rate in the *PRKN* mutation carriers. Extending our risk analyses to a larger number of potential carriers and non-carriers using genotype imputation (n = 299 carriers and n = 7,127 non-carriers), from previously published biomarkers we also observed a higher neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and lower serum albumin and sodium levels in the heterozygous *PRKN* variant carriers. These results identify a set of biomarkers that might be useful either individually or as an ensemble to identify variant carriers at greater risk of health issues due to carrier status.",

We describe the experience with the CHRIS study dynamic consent, providing an overview of its conceptualization and implementation, and of the participant-centered strategies used to assess and improve the process, directly linked to participation and communication. In order to comply with high ethical standards and to allow broadness in the areas of research, CHRIS dynamic consent was conceived as an interactive process: based on a strong governance and an ongoing tailored communication with participants, it aims to promote autonomy and to develop a trust-based engaged relationship with participants, also relevant for retention. Built within an online platform, the consent allows granular choices, which can be changed over time. In a process of co-production, participants views have been investigated and kept into account in policy development. Participants showed a high degree of participation, thus enabling the consolidation of the CHRIS resources. Even though a low change rate was reported in the baseline, participants valued the possibility of changing their informed consent choices. Communication (language-tailored, ongoing, multimedia) was important for participants, and for participation and retention. In our experience, dynamic consent was proven to be a flexible consent model, which allowed to meet ethical and legal standards for participation in research, and to accommodate participants' and researchers' needs.",

Cardiac autonomic dysfunction is a risk factor for CVD morbidity and mortality. The aim of this pilot study was to assess whether there is an association between NAFLD and impaired cardiac autonomic function. <br>**Methods and results**<br> Among the first 4979 participants from the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, we randomly recruited 173 individuals with T2DM and 183 age- and sex-matched nondiabetic controls. Participants underwent ultrasonography and vibration-controlled transient elastography (Fibroscan\u00ae, Echosens) to assess hepatic steatosis and liver stiffness. The low-to-high-frequency (LF/HF) power ratio and other heart rate variability (HRV) measures were calculated from a 20-min resting electrocardiogram (ECG) to derive a measure of cardiac sympathetic/parasympathetic imbalance. Among the 356 individuals recruited for the study, 117 had NAFLD and T2DM, 56 had T2DM alone, 68 had NAFLD alone, and 115 subjects had neither condition. Individuals with T2DM and NAFLD (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 4.29, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.90-10.6) and individuals with NAFLD alone (adjusted OR 3.41, 95% CI 1.59-7.29), but not those with T2DM alone, had a substantially increased risk of having cardiac sympathetic/parasympathetic imbalance, compared with those without NAFLD and T2DM. Logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), C-reactive protein (CRP), and Fibroscan\u00ae-measured liver stiffness. <br>**Conclusions**<br> NAFLD was associated with cardiac sympathetic/parasympathetic imbalance, regardless of the presence or absence of T2DM, liver stiffness, and other potential confounding factors.",

Despite advances in prevention and treatment, in particular through reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of blood lipid levels have led to important biological and clinical insights, as well as new drug targets, for cardiovascular disease. However, most previous GWAS have been conducted in European ancestry populations and may have missed genetic variants that contribute to lipid-level variation in other ancestry groups. These include differences in allele frequencies, effect sizes and linkage-disequilibrium patterns. Here we conduct a multi-ancestry, genome-wide genetic discovery meta-analysis of lipid levels in approximately 1.65\u2009million individuals, including 350,000 of non-European ancestries. We quantify the gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to support the expansion of recruitment of additional ancestries, even with relatively small sample sizes. We find that increasing diversity rather than studying additional individuals of European ancestry results in substantial improvements in fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic prediction (evaluated in approximately\u2009295,000 individuals from 7\u2009ancestry groupings). Modest gains in the number of discovered loci and ancestry-specific variants were also achieved. As GWAS expand emphasis beyond the identification of genes and fundamental biology towards the use of genetic variants for preventive and precision medicine, we anticipate that increased diversity of participants will lead to more accurate and equitable application of polygenic scores in clinical practice.",

Investigating unaffected heterozygous mutation carriers holds the potential of a deeper understanding of monogenic PD and has implications for PD in general, in particular regarding the prodromal phase. <br>**Objectives**<br> To discriminate healthy Parkin mutation carriers from healthy non-mutation carriers using a multimodal approach. <br>**Methods**<br> Twenty-seven healthy heterozygous Parkin mutation carriers (13 female. age: 48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013 years) and 24 healthy non-mutation carriers (14 female. age: 48\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015 years) from the CHRIS study (Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol) were recalled based on their genetic profile and underwent a blinded assessment of motor and non-motor PD symptoms, transcranial sonography and sensor-based posturography and gait analyses under different conditions with increasing difficulty. For the latter, gradient-boosted trees were used to discriminate between carriers and non-carriers. The classification accuracy and the area under the curve of the receiver-operator characteristics curve were calculated. <br>**Results**<br> We observed no differences concerning motor or non-motor symptoms and substantia nigra hyperechogenicity. The best gradient-boosted trees-based model on posturography measurements (tandem feet, eyes closed, firm surface), however, showed a classification accuracy of up to 86%. The best-performing gradient-boosted trees-based model for gait analyses showed a balanced accuracy of up to 87% (dual-tasking). <br>**Conclusions**<br> Sensor-based quantification of movements allows to discriminate unaffected heterozygous mutation carriers from mutation-free controls. Thereby, it is crucial to challenge the motor system with more difficult tasks to unmask subtle motor alterations.",

Mitochondrial DNA is present in multiple copies per cell. The quantification of mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) might be used to assess mitochondrial dysfunction. <br>**Objectives**<br> We aimed to investigate the cross-sectional association of mtDNA-CN with type 2 diabetes and the potential mediating role of metabolic syndrome. <br>**Methods**<br> We examined 4812 patients from the German Chronic Kidney Disease (GCKD) study and 9364 individuals from the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. MtDNA-CN was measured in whole blood using a plasmid-normalized qPCR-based assay. <br>**Results**<br> In both studies, mtDNA-CN showed a significant correlation with most metabolic syndrome parameters: mtDNA-CN decreased with increasing number of metabolic syndrome components. Furthermore, individuals with low mtDNA-CN had significantly higher odds of metabolic syndrome (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.025; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.011-1.039, *P*\u00a0=\u00a03.19\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup> , for each decrease of 10 mtDNA copies) and type 2 diabetes (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.027; 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.012-1.041; *P*\u00a0=\u00a02.84\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010<sup>-4</sup> ) in a model adjusted for age, sex, smoking and kidney function in the meta-analysis of both studies. Mediation analysis revealed that the association of mtDNA-CN with type 2 diabetes was mainly mediated by waist circumference in the GCKD study (66%) and by several metabolic syndrome parameters, especially body mass index and triglycerides, in the CHRIS study (41%). <br>**Conclusions**<br> Our data show an inverse association of mtDNA-CN with higher risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. A major part of the total effect of mtDNA-CN on type 2 diabetes is mediated by obesity parameters.",

        "abstract": "**Background**<br> Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by triglyceride accumulation in the hepatocytes in the absence of alcohol overconsumption, commonly associated with insulin resistance and obesity. Both NAFLD and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are characterized by an altered microbiota composition, however the role of the microbiota in NAFLD and T2D is not well understood. To assess the relationship between alteration in the microbiota and NAFLD while dissecting the role of T2D, we established a nested study on T2D and non-T2D individuals within the Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, called the CHRIS-NAFLD study. Here, we present the study protocol along with baseline and follow-up characteristics of study participants. <br>**Methods**<br> Among the first 4979 CHRIS study participants, 227 individuals with T2D were identified and recalled, along with 227 age- and sex-matched non-T2D individuals. Participants underwent ultrasound and transient elastography examination to evaluate the presence of hepatic steatosis and liver stiffness. Additionally, sampling of saliva and faeces, biochemical measurements and clinical interviews were carried out. <br>**Results**<br> We recruited 173 T2D and 183 non-T2D participants (78% overall response rate). Hepatic steatosis was more common in T2D (63.7%) than non-T2D (36.3%) participants. T2D participants also had higher levels of liver stiffness (median 4.8\u00a0kPa, interquartile range (IQR) 3.7, 5.9) than non-T2D participants (median 3.9\u00a0kPa, IQR 3.3, 5.1). The non-invasive scoring systems like the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) suggests an increased liver fibrosis in T2D (mean -\u20090.55, standard deviation, SD, 1.30) than non-T2D participants (mean -\u20091.30, SD,\u20091.17). <br>**Discussion**<br> Given the comprehensive biochemical and clinical characterization of study participants, once the bioinformatics classification of the microbiota will be completed, the CHRIS-NAFLD study will become a useful resource to further our understanding of the relationship between microbiota, T2D and NAFLD.",

Here we report a multi-ancestry (N\u2009=\u2009293,051) genome-wide association meta-analysis for the PR interval, discovering 202 loci of which 141 have not previously been reported. Variants at identified loci increase the percentage of heritability explained, from 33.5% to 62.6%. We observe enrichment for cardiac muscle developmental/contractile and cytoskeletal genes, highlighting key regulation processes for atrioventricular conduction. Additionally, 8 loci not previously reported harbor genes underlying inherited arrhythmic syndromes and/or cardiomyopathies suggesting a role for these genes in cardiovascular pathology in the general population. We show that polygenic predisposition to PR interval duration is an endophenotype for cardiovascular disease, including distal conduction disease, AF, and atrioventricular pre-excitation. These findings advance our understanding of the polygenic basis of cardiac conduction, and the genetic relationship between PR interval duration and cardiovascular disease.",

        "abstract": "**Background**<br> The presence of an early repolarization pattern (ERP) on the surface ECG is associated with risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death. Family studies have shown that ERP is a highly heritable trait, but molecular genetic determinants are unknown.<br>**Methods**<br> To identify genetic susceptibility loci for ERP, we performed a GWAS and meta-analysis in 2,181 cases and 23,641 controls of European ancestry.<br>**Results**<br> We identified a genome-wide significant (*P* < 5 \u00d7 10<sup>-8</sup>) locus in the potassium voltage-gated channel subfamily D member 3 (*KCND3*) gene that was successfully replicated in additional 1,124 cases and 12,510 controls. A subsequent joint meta-analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts identified rs1545300 as the lead SNP at the *KCND3* locus (OR 0.82 per minor T allele, *P* = 7.7 \u00d7 10<sup>-12</sup>) but did not reveal additional loci. Colocalization analyses indicate causal effects of *KCND3* gene expression levels on ERP in both cardiac left ventricle and tibial artery.<br>**Conclusions**<br> In this study, we identified for the first time to our knowledge a genome-wide significant association of a genetic variant with ERP. Our findings of a locus in the *KCND3* gene provide insights not only into the genetic determinants but also into the pathophysiological mechanism of ERP, discovering a promising candidate for functional studies.",

We performed a trans-ancestry genome-wide association study of serum urate in 457,690 individuals, identifying 183 loci (147 previously unknown) that improve the prediction of gout in an independent cohort of 334,880 individuals. Serum urate showed significant genetic correlations with many cardiometabolic traits, with genetic causality analyses supporting a substantial role for pleiotropy. Enrichment analysis, fine-mapping of urate-associated loci and colocalization with gene expression in 47 tissues implicated the kidney and liver as the main target organs and prioritized potentially causal genes and variants, including the transcriptional master regulators in the liver and kidney, *HNF1A* and *HNF4A*. Experimental validation showed that HNF4A transactivated the promoter of *ABCG2*, encoding a major urate transporter, in kidney cells, and that HNF4A p.Thr139Ile is a functional variant. Transcriptional coregulation within and across organs may be a general mechanism underlying the observed pleiotropy between urate and cardiometabolic traits.",

However, knowledge is limited about the specific mechanisms connecting lipid alterations with atrial conduction. <br>**Methods**<br> To shed light on this issue, we conducted a broad assessment of 151 sphingo- and phospholipids, measured using mass spectrometry, for association with atrial conduction, measured by P wave duration (PWD) from standard electrocardiograms, in the MICROS study (Microisolates in South Tyrol) (n=839). Causal pathways involving lipidomics, body mass index (BMI), and PWD were assessed using 2-sample Mendelian randomization analyses based on published genome-wide association studies of lipidomics (n=4034) and BMI (n=734\u2009481), and genetic association analysis of PWD in 5 population-based studies (n=24\u2009236). <br>**Results**<br> We identified an association with relative phosphatidylcholine 38:3 (%PC 38:3) concentration, which was replicated in the ORCADES (Orkney Complex Disease Study; n=951), with a pooled association across studies of 2.59 (95% CI, 1.3-3.9; *P*=1.1\u00d710<sup>-4</sup>) ms PWD per mol% increase. While being independent of cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose levels, the %PC 38:3-PWD association was mediated by BMI. Results supported a causal effect of BMI on both PWD (*P*=8.3\u00d710<sup>-5</sup>) and %PC 38:3 ( *P*=0.014). <br>**Conclusions**<br> Increased %PC 38:3 levels are consistently associated with longer PWD, partly because of the confounding effect of BMI. The causal effect of BMI on PWD reinforces evidence of BMI's involvement into atrial electrical activity.",

        "abstract": "Increased levels of the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) are associated with higher risk of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events, but underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Here, we conduct trans-ethnic (n\u2009=\u2009564,257) and European-ancestry specific meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies of UACR, including ancestry- and diabetes-specific analyses, and identify 68 UACR-associated loci. Genetic correlation analyses and risk score associations in an independent electronic medical records database (n\u2009=\u2009192,868) reveal connections with proteinuria, hyperlipidemia, gout, and hypertension. Fine-mapping and trans-Omics analyses with gene expression in 47 tissues and plasma protein levels implicate genes potentially operating through differential expression in kidney (including *TGFB1*, *MUC1*, *PRKCI*, and *OAF*), and allow coupling of UACR associations to altered plasma OAF concentrations. Knockdown of *OAF* and *PRKCI* orthologs in *Drosophila* nephrocytes reduces albumin endocytosis. Silencing fly PRKCI further impairs slit diaphragm formation. These results generate a priority list of genes and pathways for translational research to reduce albuminuria.",

Through trans-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and independent replication (n\u2009=\u20091,046,070), we identified 264 associated loci (166 new). Of these, 147 were likely to be relevant for kidney function on the basis of associations with the alternative kidney function marker blood urea nitrogen (n\u2009=\u2009416,178). Pathway and enrichment analyses, including mouse models with renal phenotypes, support the kidney as the main target organ. A genetic risk score for lower eGFR was associated with clinically diagnosed CKD in 452,264 independent individuals. Colocalization analyses of associations with eGFR among 783,978 European-ancestry individuals and gene expression across 46 human tissues, including tubulo-interstitial and glomerular kidney compartments, identified 17 genes differentially expressed in kidney. Fine-mapping highlighted missense driver variants in 11 genes and kidney-specific regulatory variants. These results provide a comprehensive priority list of molecular targets for translational research.",

Recognition and knowledge of electrolyte associations in cardiac electrophysiology are based on only in\u00a0vitro models and observations in patients with severe medical conditions. <br>**Objectives**<br> This study sought to investigate associations between serum electrolyte concentrations and changes in cardiac electrophysiology in the general population. <br>**Methods**<br> Summary results collected from 153,014 individuals (54.4% women; mean age 55.1 \u00b1 12.1 years) from 33 studies (of 5 ancestries) were meta-analyzed. Linear regression analyses examining associations between electrolyte concentrations (mmol/l of calcium, potassium, sodium, and magnesium), and electrocardiographic intervals (RR, QT, QRS, JT, and PR intervals) were performed. The study adjusted for potential confounders and also stratified by ancestry, sex, and use of antihypertensive drugs. <br>**Results**<br> Lower calcium was associated with longer QT intervals (-11.5\u00a0ms; 99.75% confidence interval [CI]: -13.7 to -9.3) and JT duration, with sex-specific effects. In contrast, higher magnesium was associated with longer QT intervals (7.2\u00a0ms; 99.75%\u00a0CI: 1.3 to 13.1) and JT. Lower potassium was associated with longer QT intervals (-2.8\u00a0ms; 99.75%\u00a0CI: -3.5 to -2.0), JT, QRS, and PR durations, but all potassium associations were driven by use of antihypertensive drugs. No physiologically relevant associations were observed for sodium or RR intervals. <br>**Conclusions**<br>The study identified physiologically relevant associations between electrolytes and electrocardiographic intervals in a large-scale analysis combining cohorts from different settings. The results provide insights for further cardiac electrophysiology research and could potentially influence clinical practice, especially the association between calcium and QT duration, by which calcium levels at the bottom 2% of the population distribution led to clinically relevant QT prolongation by >5\u00a0ms.",

        "abstract": "**Background**<br>Heart rate variability (HRV) reflects the autonomous nervous system modulation on heart rate and is associated with several pathologies, including cardiac mortality. While mechanistic studies show that smoking is associated with lower HRV, population-based studies present conflicting results. <br>**Methods**<br> We assessed the mutual effects of active smoking status, cumulative smoking history, and current smoking intensity, on HRV among 4751 adults from the Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. The HRV metrics standard deviation of normal-to-normal (NN) inter-beat intervals (SDNN), square root of the mean squared differences of consecutive NN intervals (RMSSD), total power (TP), low (LF) and high frequency (HF) power, and their ratio (LF/HF), were derived from 20-minute electrocardiograms. Smoking status, pack-years (PY), and tobacco grams/day from standardized questionnaires were the main exposures. We fitted linear mixed models to account for relatedness, non-linearity, and moderating effects, and including fractional polynomials. <br>**Results**<br> Past smokers had higher HRV levels than never smokers, independently of PY. The association of HRV with current smoking became apparent when accounting for the interaction between smoking status and PY. In current smokers, but not in past smokers, we observed HRV reductions between 2.0% (SDNN) and 4.9% (TP) every 5 PY increase. Furthermore, current smokers were characterized by dose-response reductions of 9.8% (SDNN), 8.9% (RMSSD), 20.1% (TP), 17.7% (LF), and 19.1% (HF), respectively, every 10 grams/day of smoked tobacco, independently of common cardiometabolic conditions and HRV-modifying drugs. The LF/HF ratio was not associated with smoking status, history, or intensity. <br>**Conclusions**<br> Smoking cessation was associated with higher HRV levels. In current smokers, heavier smoking intensity appears gradually detrimental on HRV, corroborating previous evidence. By affecting both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system indexes, but not the LF/HF balance, smoking intensity seems to exert a systemic dysautonomic effect.",

To facilitate this analysis, a collection of methods to detect familial aggregation in large pedigrees has been made available recently. However, efficacy of these methods in real world scenarios remains largely unknown. Here, we assess the performance of five aggregation methods to identify individuals or groups of related individuals affected by a Mendelian trait within a large set of decoys. We investigate method performance under a representative set of combinations of causal variant penetrance, trait prevalence and number of affected generations in the pedigree. These methods are then applied to assess familial aggregation of familial hypercholesterolemia and stroke, in the context of the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. <br>**Results**<br> We find that in some situations statistical hypothesis testing with a binomial null distribution achieves performance similar to methods that are based on kinship information, while kinship based methods perform better when information is available on fewer generations. Potential case families from the CHRIS study are reported and the results are discussed taking into account insights from the performance assessment. <br>**Availability and implementation**<br> The familial aggregation analysis package is freely available at the Bioconductor repository, [http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/FamAgg](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/FamAgg). <br>**Supplementary information**<br> Supplementary data are available at [Bioinformatics online](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bty541).",

Finally, we compared the metabolome of young people against elderly subjects and found that the highest number of metabolites significantly changing with age was detected in serum. <br>**Conclusions**<br> Serum samples provide higher sensitivity for biomarker discovery studies.

        "abstract": "Thyroid dysfunction is an important public health problem, which affects 10% of the general population and increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Many aspects of thyroid hormone regulation have only partly been elucidated, including its transport, metabolism, and genetic determinants. Here we report a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for thyroid function and dysfunction, testing 8 million genetic variants in up to 72,167 individuals. One-hundred-and-nine independent genetic variants are associated with these traits. A genetic risk score, calculated to assess their combined effects on clinical end points, shows significant associations with increased risk of both overt (Graves' disease) and subclinical thyroid disease, as well as clinical complications. By functional follow-up on selected signals, we identify a novel thyroid hormone transporter (SLC17A4) and a metabolizing enzyme (AADAT). Together, these results provide new knowledge about thyroid hormone physiology and disease, opening new possibilities for therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "The Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol (CHRIS) study is a population-based study with a longitudinal lookout to investigate the genetic and molecular basis of age-related common chronic conditions and their interaction with life style and environment in the general population. All adults of the middle and upper Vinschgau/Val Venosta are invited, while 10,000 participants are anticipated by mid-2017. Family participation is encouraged for complete pedigree reconstruction and disease inheritance mapping. After a pilot study on the compliance with a paperless assessment mode, computer-assisted interviews have been implemented to screen for conditions of the cardiovascular, endocrine, metabolic, genitourinary, nervous, behavioral, and cognitive system. Fat intake, cardiac health, and tremor are assessed instrumentally. Nutrient intake, physical activity, and life-course smoking are measured semi-quantitatively. Participants are phenotyped for 73 blood and urine parameters and 60 aliquots per participant are biobanked (cryo-preserved urine, DNA, and whole and fractionated blood). Through liquid-chromatography mass-spectrometry analysis, metabolite profiling of the mitochondrial function is assessed. Samples are genotyped on 1 million variants with the Illumina HumanOmniExpressExome array and the first data release including 4570 fully phenotyped and genotyped samples is now available for analysis. Participants' follow-up is foreseen 6 years after the first visit. The target population is characterized by long-term social stability and homogeneous environment which should both favor the identification of enriched genetic variants. The CHRIS cohort is a valuable resource to assess the contribution of genomics, metabolomics, and environmental factors to human health and disease. It is awaited that this will result in the identification of novel molecular targets for disease prevention and treatment.",

        "abstract": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterised by elevated serum levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a substantial risk for cardiovascular disease. The autosomal-dominant FH is mostly caused by mutations in *LDLR* (low density lipoprotein receptor), *APOB* (apolipoprotein B), and *PCSK9* (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin). Recently, *STAP1* has been suggested as a fourth causative gene. We analyzed *STAP1* in 75 hypercholesterolemic patients from Berlin, Germany, who are negative for mutations in canonical FH genes. In 10 patients with negative family history, we additionally screened for disease causing variants in *LDLRAP1* (low density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1), associated with autosomal-recessive hypercholesterolemia. We identified one *STAP1* variant predicted to be disease causing. To evaluate association of serum lipid levels and *STAP1* carrier status, we analyzed 20 individuals from a population based cohort, the Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS) study, carrying rare STAP1 variants. Out of the same cohort we randomly selected 100 non-carriers as control. In the Berlin FH cohort *STAP1* variants were rare. In the CHRIS cohort, we obtained no statistically significant differences between carriers and non-carriers of *STAP1* variants with respect to lipid traits. Until such an association has been verified in more individuals with genetic variants in *STAP1*, we cannot estimate whether *STAP1* generally is a causative gene for FH.",

However, the latent constructs determining the originally proposed 1 general score (PSQ-total) and 2 subscores (PSQ-moderate and PSQ-minor) have not been consistently investigated in population-based studies or between genders. Based on a single construct hypothesized by expert knowledge or alternative constructs upon empirical evidence, PSQ structures were explored and confirmed among 4,820 participants aged 18 to 93 years of the Cooperative Health Research In South Tyrol (CHRIS) study. By exploratory factor analysis, we identified 3 alternative sets of PSQ imagined painful situations comprising 14, 10, and 9 items, which displayed simple structures of the rotated factor loadings of direct interpretation. In confirmatory analysis (CFA) of 1 latent factor, the 10-item set yielded acceptable goodness-of-fit overall, better fit than the alternative sets and consistent structural properties between genders. Separate analyses based on 14- and 9-item sets returned considerable correlations between 2 latent constructs. In higher-order CFA with each set, 1 first-order general factor explained a large part of the variances of 2 second-order factors. One dominant construct consistently describes the factorial structure of the PSQ. Averaging across the 10-item set, the PSQ-short score represents a structurally robust, gender-consistent, and practical measure of general pain sensitivity. <br>**Perspective**<br> One dominant latent construct of general pain sensitivity consistently determines responses to the self-reported PSQ. The PSQ-short score maintains similar psychometric properties to the PSQ-total and between genders. This measure is attractive for large-scale research and clinical screening of pain sensitivity.",

In humans, the importance of this effect has remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close relatives is both rare and frequently associated with confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding coefficients (F<sub>ROH</sub>) for >1.4 million individuals, we show that F<sub>ROH</sub> is significantly associated (*p*\u2009<\u20090.0005) with apparently deleterious changes in 32 out of 100 traits analysed. These changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly rare. The effect on fertility is striking: F<sub>ROH</sub> equivalent to the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55% decrease [95% CI 44-66%] in the odds of having children. Finally, the effects of F<sub>ROH</sub> are confirmed within full-sibling pairs, where the variation in F<sub>ROH</sub> is independent of all environmental confounding.",
